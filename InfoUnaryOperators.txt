                             Unary Operators In C/C++
                                              
Unary operator are operators that act upon a single operand to produce a new value.

Types of unary operators:-

1. unary minus(-)
2. increment(++)
3. decrement(- -)
4. NOT(!)
5. Addressof operator(&)
6. sizeof()

(1) Unary minus - The minus operator changes the sign of its argument.
A positive number becomes negative, and a negative number becomes positive.

    int a = 10;
    int b = -a;  // b = -10

unary minus is different from subtraction operator, as subtraction requires two operands.

(2) Increment - It is used to increment the value of the variable by 1.
The increment can be done in two ways:

    (a)Prefix increment - In this method, the operator preceeds the operand (e.g., ++a). T
    he value of operand will be altered before it is used.
       int a = 1;
       int b = ++a;  // b = 2

    (b)Postfix increment - In this method, the operator follows the operand (e.g., a++).
    The value operand will be altered after it is used.
       int a = 1;
       int b = a++;   // b = 1
       int c = a;     // c = 2
